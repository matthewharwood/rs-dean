# Table

A semantic table for structured rows and columns.

## Live Fixtures

The embedded stories surface renders pre-filled fixtures for this component's
variants, states, themed rendering, and validation paths.

<iframe title="Table live story fixtures" src="../../../stories/#ui-table" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; min-height: 44rem; border: 1px solid #d0d7de; border-radius: 8px;"></iframe>

Open the [full stories page](../../../stories/#ui-table) when a wider canvas is
needed.
